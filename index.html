<h1><b>Occupation </b></h1>
<h3>
Roronoa Zoro’s occupation in One Piece is that of a swordsman, serving as the primary combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates. Before joining Luffy’s crew, he was widely known as the “Pirate Hunter”, a title he earned through his reputation for defeating dangerous criminals and bounty targets. As a master of Santoryu, the unique Three-Sword Style, Zoro dedicates himself to becoming the world’s greatest swordsman, fulfilling a promise to his childhood friend Kuina. His role on the crew centers on protecting his captain and crewmates through overwhelming strength, discipline, and unparalleled swordsmanship.

  <h1><b>Skill</b></h1>  
    <h3>Roronoa Zoro possesses a wide range of powerful skills that make him one of the strongest fighters in One Piece. His primary skill is mastery of swordsmanship, specifically Santoryu, the unique Three-Sword Style in which he wields a sword in each hand and one in his mouth. Zoro is known for his immense physical strength, allowing him to perform superhuman feats such as lifting massive weights and defeating towering opponents. He also has exceptional endurance and pain tolerance, often continuing to fight after sustaining life-threatening injuries. As the story progresses, Zoro gains advanced combat abilities such as Haki, including Armament Haki to enhance his blades and Observation Haki for heightened awareness. After training under Dracule Mihawk, the world’s greatest swordsman, Zoro’s precision, power, and technique reach new heights, making him a formidable warrior capable of cutting through steel, mountains, and even fire itself.

    <h1><b>Personality

    </b></h1>
    <h3>
        Roronoa Zoro’s personality is defined by his unwavering determination, stoic demeanor, and fierce loyalty. He is serious and disciplined, often serving as the calm, level-headed counterbalance to Luffy’s carefree nature. Despite his stern exterior, Zoro has a strong sense of honor and a deep respect for strength, both in himself and in others. His loyalty to Luffy is absolute—he is willing to endure extreme pain or make enormous sacrifices to protect his captain and crewmates. Zoro is also intensely competitive and driven by his dream to become the world’s greatest swordsman, a promise he refuses to break no matter the obstacle. Though often blunt, sarcastic, and easily irritated—especially by Sanji—he has a dry sense of humor and shows a surprisingly thoughtful side in critical moments.

    <h1><b>Friends</b></h1>
    <h3>Roronoa Zoro has many friends and close allies throughout One Piece, but his strongest bonds are with the Straw Hat Pirates, who are not just his crewmates but his chosen family. He is especially loyal to Monkey D. Luffy, viewing him as the captain he will stake his life on. Zoro is also close to Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, Franky, Brook, Jinbe, and the newer crewmates who join later. Although he often bickers with Sanji, their rivalry hides deep mutual respect and trust. Outside the crew, Zoro has friendly relationships with characters like Tashigi, who reminds him of his childhood friend Kuina, and he respects strong warriors such as Dracule Mihawk, despite Mihawk being both a mentor figure and his future goal to surpass. Overall, Zoro’s friendships are built on loyalty, respect, and shared battles, forming some of the strongest bonds in the series.

    <h1><b>Zoro katana</b></h1>
    <h3>Roronoa Zoro wields several powerful and iconic katanas throughout One Piece, each contributing to his growth as a swordsman. His most treasured blade is Wado Ichimonji, a white katana inherited from his childhood friend Kuina, which symbolizes his vow to become the world’s greatest swordsman. He later acquires Sandai Kitetsu, a cursed sword known for bringing misfortune to its wielders, but Zoro’s sheer willpower allows him to tame it. Another of his long-standing swords is Shusui, a black blade once belonging to the legendary samurai Ryuma, though it is eventually returned to Wano in exchange for the powerful Enma—a sword that draws out its user’s Haki and demands immense control. These blades, paired with Zoro’s Three-Sword Style, form the core of his strength and identity as one of the strongest swordsmen in the series.

<h1><b>Zoro captain</b></h1>
<h3>Roronoa Zoro’s captain is Monkey D. Luffy, the founder and leader of the Straw Hat Pirates. Zoro was the first person to join Luffy’s crew, and from that moment on, he pledged absolute loyalty to him. Despite being strong-willed and independent, Zoro never questions Luffy’s position as captain and even enforces respect for Luffy’s authority among the crew. He believes completely in Luffy’s dream of becoming the Pirate King and is willing to risk his life to protect both Luffy and that dream. This loyalty is one of Zoro’s defining traits and a major reason he is considered the crew’s most reliable right-hand man.</h3>

<h1><b>Zoro frist bounty</b></h1>
<h3>Roronoa Zoro’s first bounty in One Piece was 60,000,000 berries, which he received after the events of the Alabasta Arc. This bounty was a reward for his role in defeating Mr. 1 (Daz Bones), a powerful Baroque Works officer, and for his contributions in helping the Straw Hat Pirates stop Crocodile and his criminal organization. The bounty reflected the World Government’s recognition of Zoro as a dangerous and highly skilled swordsman, even early in the crew’s journey. It marked the beginning of his reputation as one of the strongest and most formidable members of the Straw Hat Pirates.

<h1><b>Zoro vs Mihawkk</b></h1>
<h3>Zoro vs. Mihawk is a battle of student versus master, and right now Mihawk still wins. As the current World’s Strongest Swordsman, Mihawk remains above post–time skip Zoro, though the gap has narrowed a lot since their first encounter. However, by the end of the series, Zoro is destined to surpass Mihawk to achieve his dream, making a future victory for Zoro inevitable.</h3>

<h1><b>How zoro get katana</b></h1>
<h3>Zoro acquires his katanas through important moments tied to his growth. He receives Wado Ichimonji from his dojo master after the death of his friend Kuina, carrying it as a symbol of his promise. In Loguetown, he gains Sandai Kitetsu by testing his luck against its curse and is gifted Yubashiri by the sword shop owner, though that blade is later destroyed. After defeating the zombie samurai Ryuma on Thriller Bark, Zoro earns Shusui as a mark of respect, but later returns it to Wano and is given Enma, Oden’s legendary sword, by Hiyori. Each katana Zoro obtains represents a major step in his journey to becoming the world’s greatest swordsman.</h3>
